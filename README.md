node-fit
========

Garmin FIT file parser for nodejs.

This project is just starting. I am creating a native C++ node binding for the [FIT SDK v6.00](http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/).

The goal for this project is to be able to both decode and encode FIT files. If you have an interest in getting involved with this project, please get in touch!
